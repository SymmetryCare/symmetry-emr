/// The signed-out half of EMR: the login flow.
///
/// The login screens are Navigator 1.0 code — they `pushNamed` each other
/// with arguments and finish with `pushReplacementNamed(emrDesktop)` — so they
/// keep their own `MaterialApp` and the route table main.dart used to hold,
/// rather than being rewritten onto the signed-in screens' go_router.
/// RIS and Establishment split their apps the same way.
///
/// Reaching [RouteStrings.emrDesktop] (or `/home`) means the token is written,
/// so that route starts the [AppSession] and main.dart swaps this whole app
/// for the signed-in one.
///
/// The email a code was sent to travels between the steps as the route's
/// arguments, as it always has. A step reached without it — after a refresh,
/// or from a typed URL — opens the login screen instead.
///
/// Shell-hosted, the login form belongs to the shell: every route that would
/// render one redirects there instead (see [_loginOrShell]).
