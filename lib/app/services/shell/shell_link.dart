/// Whether this Establishment build is hosted behind symmetry-shell, and how to get back.
///
/// Establishment runs in two shapes and both have to keep working:
///
/// * **Standalone** — Establishment served at the site root, its own login screen, no
///   module picker. This is what every existing tenant runs today.
/// * **Shell-hosted** — symmetry-shell at `/`, Establishment at `/establishment/`, on one origin. The
///   user signs in once at the shell, picks Establishment Manager, and Establishment opens
///   already signed in because `TokenManager` reads the session out of
///   `localStorage`, which is shared across paths on the same origin.
///
/// Which one is decided at build time by [_shellPath], and it defaults to
/// **empty — standalone**. So nothing here changes how Establishment behaves unless the
/// deployer explicitly opts in with:
///
/// ```
/// flutter build web --base-href=/establishment/ --dart-define=SHELL_PATH=/
/// ```
///
/// That default is the point: a build that forgets the flag degrades to today's
/// behaviour rather than sending users to a page that may not be deployed.
