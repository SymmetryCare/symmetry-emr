        <li>If you choose to appeal, the independent reviewer will ask for your opinion. The reviewer also will look at your medical records and/or other relevant information. You do not have to prepare anything in writing, but you have the right to do so if you Wish.</li>    
        <li>If you choose to appeal, you and the independent reviewer will each receive a copy of the detailed explanation about why your coverage for services should not continue. You will receive this detailed notice only after you request an appeal.</li>
        <li>If you choose to appeal, and the independent reviewer agrees services should no longer be covered after the effective date indicated above;<ul><li>Neither Medicare nor your plan will pay for these services after that date.</li></ul></li>
